# Beyond - Readme

This readme provides an overview of the Beyond application and its installation process.

## About The Project 
Beyond is a project designed to simulate an immersive experience of interstellar travel and exploration. It aims to provide users a glimpse into the future of space exploration and the possibility of interplanetary travel. Please note that Beyond is purely a conceptual project and does not offer real interstellar travel services.

The application uses the SpaceX API to fetch data related to upcoming launches, mission details, and other relevant information. Also it uses the API provided by "Le système solaire" to receive detailed information about the planets in our solar system.

Users can explore different planets, such as the Moon, Mars, and Titan, to learn more about their characteristics, astronomical data, and potential for future exploration.
